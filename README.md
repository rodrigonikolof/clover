# clover

<h2>What is it?</h2>
Clover is the final project for my software engineering course. </br> 
The application is being made as per requirements established by a psycologist (my wife) and aims to streamline goal management for each client. 

<h2>What technologies does it use?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Javascript / React frontend </li>
  <li>Ruby / Rails backend</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where is it up to?</h2>
The initial phase of Clover is nearly complete and will be deployed soon :)
